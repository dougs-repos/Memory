# Memory

I have updated all of my memory documents and now have compiled them into three books for sale on Amazon. They are grouped in a series called *Memory Techniques and Toolkits* by Douglas Hoff. There are paperback and Kindle versions available.
- [Memory Techniques - a systematic analysis of modern mnemonics](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C39JLJ7Y)
- [Memory Toolbox - design tools for modern mnemonics](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CJ9SYPBJ)
- [7711 Bible Memorization by Chapter Themes - The New Testament](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CJ9W2JQD)
